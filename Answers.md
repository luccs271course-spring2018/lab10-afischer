# COMP 271 002 F17 Lab 8 (Week 10)

# Q1
Both treeMap and hashmap implement the ADT map whose methods we are using. 
Because of this there is no difference.

# Q2
The resulting map is as if all the iterators were used as one. 

# Q3
The iterator makes it so that we can do the tests because without it in main the input would come 
directly from console input and we cannot do console input in a test suite.
